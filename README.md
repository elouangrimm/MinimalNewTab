# MinimalNewTab

## An extremely minimal New Tab Page!

Basically just install the `.crx` file in the [**releases**](https://github.com/elouangrimm/MinimalNewTab/releases) tab and you are good!

To use the extension, just click on the extension icon and either pick a color or use the eyedrop tool to pick a color anywhere on your screen! Amazing!
